# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š TrevorText - Copilot-augmented

Empower Trevor Project counselors with RAG-assisted TrevorText, an AI co-pilot powered by LlamaIndex to help counselors focus on people, not paperwork. Link to Hackathon Submission: https://devpost.com/software/counselor-copilot

In this version, we artificially simulate the contact's responses. The extension would be to integrate the tool with the existing SalesForce CRM and webchat platform used by the Trevor Project.

## Local Dev Loop

Pre-req: ensure poetry is installed globally ([Reference](https://python-poetry.org/docs/))

Use python version in .python-version file


`virtualenv -v venv-trevorhack-streamlit && source venv-trevorhack-streamlit/bin/activate`
Create and activate virtual environment


`touch .env` 
From project root, create environment variable file and add the following variables ([Reference](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/astra-db-vector/integrations/llamaindex.html))
```
ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN="TOKEN"
ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT="API_ENDPOINT"
OPENAI_API_KEY="API_KEY"
```

`poetry install`
Install deps


`streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
Run app from the project root


The dev server can be accessed at [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501/)


Additional Notes:

`kill -9 $(lsof -i:8501 -t) 2> /dev/null`
To quickly kill any process running on port 8501


## Overview of the App

<img src="app.png" width="75%">

- Takes user queries via Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and displays both user queries and model responses with `st.chat_message`
- Uses LlamaIndex to load and index data and create a chat engine that will retrieve context from that data to respond to each user query
- Copilot Agent takes actions using provided tools to search the web for resources, escalate cases, and retrieve relevant documents to inform recommended responses.
